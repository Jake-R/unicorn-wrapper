# Unicorn-wrapper

A wrapper that uses Python's language features to streamline the interface to Unicorn Engine. Mostly functional.

Currently you can read and write registers and memory and apply hooks. As time goes on more features will be converted with the goal of avoiding the use of constants and keeping things as Pythonicâ„¢ as possible.

## Examples
```python
# Initializing an emulator:
# Unicorn
mu = Uc(UC_ARCH_ARM64, UC_MODE_ARM)
#unicorn wrapper
mu = wrapper.factory.arm64_arm()

# mapping a memory segment:
# Unicorn
mu.mem_map(ADDRESS, 2 * 1024 * 1024)
#unicorn_wrapper
mu[ADDRESS] = 2*1024*1024

#writing to memory:
#Unicorn
mu.mem_write(ADDRESS, ARM64_CODE)
#unicorn_wrapper
mu[ADDRESS] = ARM64_CODE

#reading memory:
#Unicorn
mu.mem_read(ADDRESS, len(ARM64_CODE))
#unicorn_wrapper
mu[ADDRESS:ADDRESS+len(ARM64_CODE)]

#reading a register:
#Unicorn
mu.reg_read(UC_ARM64_REG_X11)
#unicorn_wrapper
mu.reg.x11

#writing a register:
#Unicorn
mu.reg_write(UC_ARM64_REG_X11, 0x12345678)
#unicorn_wrapper
mu.reg.x11 = 0x12345678

#hooking blocks
#Unicorn
def hook_block(uc, address, size, user_data):
    print(">>> Tracing basic block at 0x%x, block size = 0x%x" %(address, size))
mu.hook_add(UC_HOOK_BLOCK, hook_block)
#unicorn-wrapper
@Hook.hook_block
def hook_block(uc, address, size, user_data):
    print(">>> Tracing basic block at 0x%x, block size = 0x%x" %(address, size))
# or
mu.hook_block(hook_block)
```
